This script manages airlocks and other airtight rooms so that oxygen is not lost.

Please use the following naming convention for doors/vents (with no brackets necessary).
Note that the names just need to contain the following substrings.
The script will also distinguish between identical room names on different subgrids.
* Outer doors (which lead to vacuum/space): [Room] Outer
* Inner doors (which lead to pressurized areas): [Room 1]/[Room 2]
* Air vents: [Room] Vent
